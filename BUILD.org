#+TITLE: Basic build

# Build in a container
For now the recommended way is to build using the given Containerfile.
This can be done with the following commands:

#+begin_src bash
podman build -f Containerfile -t iotrace/build
podman run -v .:/usr/share/code -it iotrace/build
meson setup builddir /usr/share/code
ninja -C builddir
meson install -C builddir
#+end_src

# Vendored build
The project and all its dependencies can be built with the following commands:
#+begin_src bash
cmake -B /tmp/build -S libs -DINSTALL_DIR=$VENDOR_PATH && cmake --build /tmp/build
CC=clang CC_LD=lld meson setup builddir . -Dpkg_config_path="$VENDOR_PATH/lib64/pkgconfig:$VENDOR_PATH/lib/pkgconfig"
ninja -C builddir
#+end_src

Work will be done to add dependencies wrap and remove the need to build the dependencies before building the project.


# Non vendored manual builds
For manual builds the following dependencies are needed:
- zlib
- libelf
- libbpf
